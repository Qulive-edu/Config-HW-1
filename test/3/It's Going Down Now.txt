… It's those unintelligent monsters, ain't it?
What are they thinking? Please, explain it
Don't really need this crap, can't waste time
What I possess can't copy and paste down
… I'm doing it better, never settling for another regular
Letter to my enemies, hey, I'm telling ya
I'm breaking you down to the level of molecular
… Better be wise when you're choosing battles, it's mostly babbles
You know one of those big-time shady foe-foes ain't worth fighting for
I drop these bars in my sleep
Few more tricks up my sleeve
It's way too late for you to leave now (get ready)
… Disturbing the peace
Look into my eyes
Now tell me the things
You know, laughing about behind my back
… The tenacity I hold
I hope it's hard to break down
It's too late for apologies
It's going down now
… You're thirsty for some blood
Actually craving for love
What you only want is dub
Greed makes you go numb
… Purposefully, blocking good thoughts
Hey, please, doctor, doctor
He's about to be that patient
'Cause I'm about to knock him out cold
(Bring him back, please)
… Whole lotta moves I make on you like dance floor
And during this beat down
You prolly wish that you can fast-forward (oh)
Don't you worry about it
I'll save some room for your last words
After I do this, do that, and the third
… Disturbing the peace
Look into my eyes
Now tell me the things
You're blabbing about behind my back
… The tenacity I hold
It's hard to break down
It's too late for apologies
It's going-
… Some things may break me
But always get back up
New perspective gained
From all the pain and stress
… And when I do come back
I'm stronger than ever before
So, kneel down
… Disturbing the peace
Look into my eyes
Now tell me the things
You're blabbing about behind my back
… The tenacity I hold
It's hard to break down
It's too late for apologies
It's going down
